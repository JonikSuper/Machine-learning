The data consists of a number of tissue samples corresponding to four distinct types of small round blue cell tumors. 
For each tissue sample, 2308 gene expression measurements are available.

The format is a list containing four components: xtrain, xtest, ytrain, and ytest. 
xtrain contains the 2308 gene expression values for 63 subjects and ytrain records the corresponding tumor type. 
ytrain and ytest contain the corresponding testing sample information for a further 20 subjects.
